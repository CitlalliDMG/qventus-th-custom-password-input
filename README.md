## About The Project

Welcome to my solution proposal for the Qventus Take Home challenge! In this repository you will find my solution to the coding challenge of creating a react component that works as an password field that accept a list of password requirements.

### Technical Requirements

- [x] Using the React framework
- [ ] React component should accept a list of password requirements as a prop:
  - [ ] The list of requirements can be flexible (has 1 or more)
  - [ ] The following password requirements must be implemented and available in the library:
    - [ ] Has one or more of these special characters: !@#$%^&\*
    - [ ] Has a number / digit
    - [ ] Has an uppercase letter
    - [ ] Has NO identical consecutive letters
  - [ ] The component should be styled as shown in the GIF, but should be able to be extended
  - [ ] There should be a way for us to validate your implementation - this could be automated testing, a reference build, whatever youâ€™re comfortable with.

### Built With

For the development of this project, the main technologies I used were:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Icons Kit](https://react-icons-kit.vercel.app/)
- [React-Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
